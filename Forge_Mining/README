Front End for Forge Mining

BASIC SETUP (needs Node8)

    npm install -g node-gyp

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

    npm install

    npm run webpack #(to build the website files)

    rename 'sample.account.config.js' to 'account.config.js' and fill it with the pool's ethereum account data

    install redis-server and make sure it is running

    Edit pool.config.js to your tastes

    Edit the website files in /app to change the look of the website

    npm run server #(or npm run server test for Ropsten test net)

HOW TO USE

    Point a poolminer at your pool using http://localhost:8586 (or ipaddress:8586 or domain.com:8586) (make sure firewall allows this port)
    View website interface at http://localhost:3000 (you can set up nginx to serve the static files in /public)

Installing Redis

    sudo apt-get install redis
    sudo service redis-server start

    Redis will serve/connect at localhost:6379 by default - the pool will use this port
